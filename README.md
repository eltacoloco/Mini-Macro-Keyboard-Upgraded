# Mini-Macro-Keyboard-Upgraded

I made the Stream Cheap (Mini Macro Keyboard) made by DaveM on thingiverse which emulates the unused F13-F24 keys.
But the code wasn't made for simulationg keycombination presses (like shift+F1 and such and the games/programs I wanted to use it with don't support F13-F24), so I made some changes to the code to make it work like I want to. 

The code is made for the Arduino Pro Micro 5V board with HID support. 


THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND I'M STILL TRYING THE CODE OUT, SO USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!</br>
(the code might change so it can be good to keep an eye here for updates)
